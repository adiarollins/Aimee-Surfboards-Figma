# Aimee's Surfboards Figma

## Summary

This project is an original Figma design for **Aimee’s Surfboards**, a fictional brand I created. I built it while following the **UX Design UI Essentials Course** on Skillshare, led by *Dan Scott*. The course taught me beginner-friendly UX/UI fundamentals, including:

- Creating wireframes, prototypes, and interactive flows  
- Choosing colors, fonts, and images to match a design brief  
- Building reusable components, icons, and UI elements  
- Using auto-layout, constraints, variants, and other Figma tools  
- Testing designs on mobile devices and preparing files for handoff  
- Applying real-world UX practices to portfolio-building projects  

I applied these skills to design this concept from scratch. The repo includes all screens, layout decisions, design assets, and a demo showing how the app flows and feels.

## Motivation

I created this project to practice UX/UI fundamentals in Figma and apply beginner-friendly design techniques from the Skillshare course. The goal was to experiment with layout, color, and interactive flows while building a fictional surfboard shopping app.
