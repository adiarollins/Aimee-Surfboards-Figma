# Aimee's-Surfboards-Figma

## Summary

This project is an original Figma design for Aimee’s Surfboards, a fictional brand I created. I built it while following the UX Design UI Essentials Course on Skillshare, led by Dan Scott. The course taught me beginner-friendly UX/UI fundamentals, including:

Creating wireframes, prototypes, and interactive flows

Choosing colors, fonts, and images to match a design brief

Building reusable components, icons, and UI elements

Using auto-layout, constraints, variants, and other Figma tools

Testing designs on mobile devices and preparing files for handoff

Applying real-world UX practices to portfolio-building projects

I applied these skills to design this concept from scratch. The repo includes all screens, layout decisions, design assets, and a demo showing how the app flows and feels.

## 🎥 Demo Video

Here's a video that demos all of the app's implemented features:
